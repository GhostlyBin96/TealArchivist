          <Title>Library Director</Title>
          <Content>Well, that’s it then. The Teal Archivist became a book, just as she expected might happen. It’s... surreal, having a book that is essentially my own, but not the one book I’m striving to obtain.</Content>

          <Title>Servant</Title>
          <Content>Wasn’t expecting all of that either. I think that’s more than enough of your reality-hopping twin’s mind I didn’t need to see, no offense.</Content>

          <Teller>Angela</Teller>
          <Title>Library Director</Title>
          <Content>I believe I can say the same. That was… far too personal. Is there really a chance we’ll end up in the same state?</Content>

          <Title>Servant</Title>
          <Content>Well, we got her book, and she said it would probably help. Speaking of. Do you think she was telling the truth? About that Pluto guy showing up, I mean.</Content>

          <Content>I’m surprised you remembered. Indeed I am, though as you can plainly see much has changed since then. Sadly I’m not as open with my life as Miss Teal is, so I’ll leave you to ruminate on that...</Content>

          <Content>Oh well.~ While I find Angela’s attempts to prevent the inevitable endearing, it isn’t our problem. As long as we retrieve her in time, we’ll be able to wash our hands of this nonsense.</Content>

          <Content>Besides, we have our own issues to worry about. I was hoping that Eileen would be willing to join us, but it seems her conviction lies with Argalia and not myself. Best to leave her be for now. Any idea where Philip is?</Content>
